:do_not_litter: Fritz!Box Blacklist
===================================

A list of domains to be blocked in my Fritz!Box.

This project is meant to help some companies to see the benefits of HTTPS. :smiley:

Instructions
------------

1. See [AVM's instructions on how to setup a blacklist in your Fritz!Box](http://avm.de/nc/service/fritzbox/fritzbox-7390/wissensdatenbank/publication/show/8_Internetnutzung-mit-Kindersicherung-einschraenken/)
2. Be sure to check if HTTPS traffic is still allowed
3. Copy contents of [fritzbox-blacklist.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fboes/fritzbox-blacklist/master/fritzbox-blacklist.txt) to your Fritz!Box' blacklist

This will work with a standard firmware.
